# Modeling-the-classification-of-users-into-various-types-of-lifestyles-tribes-based-on-tribal-marketing-in-Twitter

The emerging of web 2.0 and the social media platforms which have been created for different personalities, lead to the daily increasing involvement of people globally with these platforms. Due to the wide communications through social networks, there are numerous opportunities for individuals, groups and businesses to analyze these virtual environments. 
To enhance the marketing strategies and to identify the most potential customers, we surveyed selected influencers of particular lifestyle tribes such as “Travel, Fitness, Fashion, Art and Vegan” to train and create a model based on machine learning techniques, text processing and web scrapping to present an effective tool to automatically classify Twitter users into pre-defined tribes upon their Twitter pages’ details. At this point, we could nearly scrape 45,000 tweets for 420 related influencers and have them as training set in the model. Thereafter, we evaluated the parameter optimization to reach the best parameters for our model, thus, we achieve adequate accuracy parameters, the accuracy of 74.3% and recall of 71.5%. We intended to get further feedbacks so by deploying the model, we selected the sample of 10 reputable brands in each tribe to have the comparison of the brands’ mindset with their virtual tribes’ facts.
